# opencode-context-graph

Live session token and Code Mode attribution for server consumers.

## What it does

Times the inner calls of Code Mode programs. When an execute call is slow, the recorded spans name the call that took the time instead of blaming the whole program. It adds no tools.

## What it needs

- an OpenCode 2 host

## Install

Run `bun install` in this directory once, then add this directory's absolute
path to `plugins` in your OpenCode configuration and reload.

## Check

Use the package through your OpenCode2 server, then inspect the saved result
after reopening. The builder checks entrypoint bundling; that does not prove
product behavior.

## Files

`plugin.json` declares entrypoints, runtime assets, what the package does and
what it needs. `distribution.json` records every shipped source and its hash.
Relative dependencies are vendored from the same source revision; no sibling
repository layout is assumed. The maintained source is the owner's directory in
the QuestGiver repository;
[opencode-plugins](https://github.com/Noisemaker111/opencode-plugins) publishes
releases of these packages.

User configuration, account credentials, Quest ledgers and runtime state are
not distributed. Quest storage defaults to `~/.opencode/quests`;
`OPENCODE_QUEST_ROOT` explicitly overrides the ledger's project root.
